# Witch Saga

This C# console application simulates a scenario where users input data about individuals (age of death and year of death) to calculate the average number of villagers killed by a witch. The program uses a WitchHunter class to process the data and determine the average based on a predefined logic or formula. It features an interactive loop, allowing users to input multiple datasets and view the results before choosing to exit.
